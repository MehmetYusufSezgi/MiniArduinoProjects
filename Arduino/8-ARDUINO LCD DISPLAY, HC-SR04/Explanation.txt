
This project integrates an LCD display and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to measure and display distances. It initializes the necessary pins for the sensor and LCD display, with the sensor connected to pins 7 (trigPin) and 6 (echoPin), and the LCD display connected to digital pins 12 through 2. In the setup function, it sets the pin modes and initializes the LCD display with 16 columns and 2 rows. During operation in the loop function, it triggers the ultrasonic sensor, measures the duration of the echo signal, calculates the distance based on the speed of sound, and displays the result on the LCD. The displayed distance is updated every 250 milliseconds, providing real-time distance monitoring on the LCD display.
