
This Arduino sketch integrates an IR flying fish sensor with a buzzer to provide an alert when the detected gas level surpasses a specified threshold. The IR flying fish sensor is connected to analog pin A0 to read the gas level, while the buzzer is connected to digital pin 9 for auditory feedback. The threshold value is set to 100 to indicate the maximum acceptable gas level.

In the setup function, the buzzerPin is configured as an output to control the buzzer.

During operation in the loop function, the code continuously reads the analog signal from the IR flying fish sensor using the analogRead function and stores it in the variable 'value'. If the gas level exceeds the threshold (when 'value' is greater than 100), the buzzer emits a tone with a frequency of 440 Hz using the tone function for 100 milliseconds, followed by a pause of 100 milliseconds. This sequence repeats to produce an intermittent alert signal.

When the gas level is within the acceptable range (when 'value' is less than or equal to the threshold), the buzzer is turned off using the noTone function.
