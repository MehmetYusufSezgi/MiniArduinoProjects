This Arduino sketch integrates a soil moisture sensor with a buzzer to provide an alert when the soil moisture level surpasses a certain threshold. The soil moisture sensor is connected to pin 9 (sensorPin), while the buzzer is connected to pin 8 (buzzerPin). In the setup function, the pins are configured accordingly: sensorPin as an input to read the sensor data and buzzerPin as an output to control the buzzer.

During operation in the loop function, the code continuously reads the digital signal from the soil moisture sensor using the digitalRead function and stores it in the variable 'data'. If the soil moisture level exceeds the threshold (when 'data' is true), the buzzer emits a tone with a frequency of 440 Hz using the tone function for 100 milliseconds, followed by a pause of 100 milliseconds. This sequence is repeated to produce an intermittent alert signal. When the soil moisture level is within an acceptable range (when 'data' is false), the buzzer is turned off using the noTone function.
