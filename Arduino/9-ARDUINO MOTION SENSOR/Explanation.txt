This Arduino sketch utilizes a Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor to detect motion in its vicinity. The sensor's output is connected to digital pin 8 (pirPin). In the setup function, pin 8 is configured as an input to read the sensor's signal. During operation in the loop function, the code continuously reads the digital signal from the PIR sensor using the digitalRead function. If motion is detected (when the sensor output goes HIGH), the buzzer connected to pin 7 (buzzerPin) emits a tone with a frequency of 440 Hz using the tone function. When no motion is detected (when the sensor output is LOW), the buzzer is turned off using the noTone function. This setup allows the Arduino to respond to motion detected by the PIR sensor by activating the buzzer, providing a simple motion detection and alert system.
