This Arduino sketch initializes an array 'leds' containing pin numbers where LEDs are connected. In the setup function, it configures these pins as outputs to control the LEDs.

The loop function then executes two loops. The first loop sequentially turns on and off each LED from pins 2 to 7, with a short delay between each transition. Following this, the second loop does the same in reverse order, turning off the LEDs in the opposite sequence. This setup creates a visual effect where the LEDs appear to 'chase' in one direction and then reverse.
