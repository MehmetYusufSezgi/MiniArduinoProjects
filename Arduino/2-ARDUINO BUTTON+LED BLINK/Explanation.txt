This project utilizes Arduino pins 8 and 10, defining pin 8 as the input for a button and pin 10 as the output for an LED. In the setup function, it configures pin 8 as input and pin 10 as output.

During the main loop, the code constantly checks the status of the button connected to pin 8. If the button is pressed (indicating a status of 1), it enters a loop that blinks the LED connected to pin 10 for 20 cycles, each cycle consisting of a brief period of illumination followed by a brief pause. If the button is not pressed (status 0), it ensures the LED remains off.
